### FAQ ###

**What type of equipment do I need?** If you have a headset, that's perfect. If you have a separate mic, please use headphones to avoid spill from the speakers to the mic.

**How long does it take to record an episode?** We like guests to be part of the whole show. Warming up with the casual news discussion, and then Q&A, and finally the picks of the week and plugs. In total, this typically takes **1.5 hours**.

**How long before my episode goes live?** It could be as quickly as that same day, or 2 weeks out depending on whether we're trying to pre-record episodes for the following weeks.
